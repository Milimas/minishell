# libft

The libft project is a recreation of common C library functions for educational purposes. The goal of the project is to gain a deeper understanding of the functions and to improve coding skills. The library includes functions for handling strings, memory, and other basic operations. The project is written in C and is designed to be used in future projects at 1337 school, a school that focuses on teaching coding skills through project-based learning.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

- GCC or another C compiler
- make

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/libft.git`

1. Enter the directory: `cd libft`

1. Compile the library: `make`

## Usage

Include the library in your C project by adding the following line to your source code:

```c
#include "libft.h"
```

You can also use the library in your local machine by adding the path to your library to your environment variables.

## Deployment

To use the library in other projects, you can copy the libft.a file and the libft.h header file to the project directory, and include the header file in your source code as described in the Usage section.

## Functions

The Library contains a list of functions, the most important of them are :

* Memory functions : ft_memset, ft_bzero, ft_memcpy, ft_memccpy, ft_memmove, ft_memchr, ft_memcmp.

* String functions : ft_strlen, ft_strdup, ft_strcpy, ft_strncpy, ft_strcat, ft_strncat, ft_strlcat, ft_strchr, ft_strrchr, ft_strstr, ft_strnstr, ft_strcmp, ft_strncmp.

* Character functions : ft_isalpha, ft_isdigit, ft_isalnum, ft_isascii, ft_isprint.

* Conversion functions : ft_atoi, ft_itoa.

* List functions : ft_lstnew, ft_lstdelone, ft_lstdel, ft_lstadd, ft_lstiter, ft_lstmap.
